<a id="welcome-to-lexis-site" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-lexis-site" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Lexi's Site.</h3>

<p>Lexi is still small, but is bigger than <a href="http://emma-buckland.com">Emma</a>, and has already started to learn about logic. She doesn't really write code, but likes pressing the CAPS-LOCK key on Daddy's laptop because it lights up. She is learning how to build other stuff, with lego and cans, and already knows how to break things, so when she finishes reading basic princess documentation, she'll be building her own website.</p>

<p>Her <a href="https://github.com/alexbuckland">Daddy</a> maintains this for now.</p>
